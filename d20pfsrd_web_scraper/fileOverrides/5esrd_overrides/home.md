# DnD5e SRD

Welcome to the **DnD5e SRD** created by [this script](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/d20pfsrd_obsidian_importer).

The script scraped https://www.5esrd.com/ and converted the files into markdown.

### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The [script](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/d20pfsrd_obsidian_importer) is still under construction. Should you
encounter any issue that seems to be related to the way this vault is parsed
please [open an issue](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/d20pfsrd_obsidian_importer/issues) on github, if there isn't one
for the problem already.

### Credits

99.9% of the content in here was not collected by [me](https://github.com/mProjectsCode), but by the wonderful people
behind [5esrd](https://www.5esrd.com/). So go and check them out and give them all the [support](https://www.5esrd.com/)
they deserve.

[I](https://github.com/mProjectsCode) just wrote the script to convert [5esrd](https://www.5esrd.com/) into
this [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. You can support me by giving
the [repo on github](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/d20pfsrd_obsidian_importer) a star or by just spreading the word.
