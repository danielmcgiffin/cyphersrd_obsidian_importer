# Pathfinder SRD

Welcome to the **Cypher SRD** created by [this script](https://github.com/danielmcgiffin/cyphersrd_obsidian_importer).

The script scraped https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/ and converted the files into markdown.

### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The [script](https://github.com/danielmcgiffin/cyphersrd_obsidian_importer) is still under construction. Should you
encounter any issue that seems to be related to the way this vault is parsed
please [open an issue](https://github.com/danielmcgiffin/cyphersrd_obsidian_importer/issues) on github, if there isn't one
for the problem already.

### Credits

99.9% of the content in here was not collected by [me](https://github.com/danielmcgiffin), but by the wonderful people
behind [cyphersrd](https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/). So go and check them out! Also thanks to [mProjectsCode](https://github.com/mProjectsCode), 
whose SRD scraper I forked!

[I](https://github.com/danielmcgiffin) just wrote the script to convert [cyphersrd](https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/) into
this [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. You can support me by giving
the [repo on github](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/cyphersrd_obsidian_importer) a star or by just spreading the word.
